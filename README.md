# Python_EDA_MitoSheet_AI
📊 Python Exploratory Data Analysis using MitoSheet AI
🔹 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python with the help of MitoSheet AI.
The analysis was performed in the MitoSheet app, which provides a Jupyter-equivalent environment with a spreadsheet-like interface that automatically generates Python code.

The goal of this project is to understand the dataset structure, perform basic data quality checks, visualize patterns, and extract clear insights in an efficient and beginner-friendly way.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

MitoSheet AI

ChatGPT

📌 Key Steps Performed

Loaded and explored the dataset to understand rows, columns, and data types

Checked for missing values and duplicate records

Performed basic descriptive statistics such as mean, minimum, and maximum

Created simple visualizations to understand distributions and trends

Conducted basic group-wise analysis where applicable

Extracted clear and easy-to-understand insights from the data

During the analysis, a dataset import issue occurred, which was quickly resolved using MitoSheet AI, ensuring a smooth workflow.

💡 Key Learnings

Hands-on experience with Python-based EDA

Understanding how AI-assisted tools like MitoSheet AI can speed up exploratory analysis
