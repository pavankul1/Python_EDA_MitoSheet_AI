# Python_EDA_MitoSheet_AI
📊 Python Exploratory Data Analysis using MitoSheet AI
🔹 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python with the help of MitoSheet AI.
The analysis was performed in the MitoSheet app, which provides a Jupyter-equivalent environment with a spreadsheet-like interface that automatically generates Python code.

The goal of this project is to understand the dataset structure, perform basic data quality checks, visualize patterns, and extract clear insights in an efficient and beginner-friendly way.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python

pandas

numpy

matplotlib
